GitHub Documents
----------------

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Multiple Structure Alignment
----------------------------

Requesting the A chain of selected PDBs:

``` r
library(bio3d)
ids <- c("1TND_B","1AGR_A","1TAG_A","1GG2_A","1KJY_A","4G5Q_A")
files <- get.pdb(ids, split = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning in get.pdb(ids, split = TRUE): ./1TND.pdb exists. Skipping download

    ## Warning in get.pdb(ids, split = TRUE): ./1AGR.pdb exists. Skipping download

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Multiple Structure Alignment

Requesting the A chain of selected PDBs:

```{r multi pdb}
library(bio3d)
ids <- c("1TND_B","1AGR_A","1TAG_A","1GG2_A","1KJY_A","4G5Q_A")
files <- get.pdb(ids, split = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
